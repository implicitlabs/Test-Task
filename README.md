# TODO LIST

There is a TODO list written in `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` - https://jsfiddle.net/ArmanZohrabyan/Ldjs6kav/1/

You need to take the code and write everything in `ReactJS` and `SCSS`.

1. Need to store data in `redux`.
2. Try to demonstrate the capabilities of `SCSS`.
3. Data list should not be deleted when the page is refreshed. (advisable to use `redux-persist`)
4. Write the code so that there aren't unnecessary renders.
5. ONLY when adding a new item to the list - do it asynchronously. (use for this `setTimeout` / `Promise` and `redux-think`)
6. Add a button that delete the TODO list.
7. Upload the code to `github`.
